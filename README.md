# Real Estate Website
This repository contains the source code and assets for a Real Estate website that is currently under construction. The website aims to provide a platform for users to search for, browse, and inquire about real estate properties.

# Features
Property search: Users can search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price range, number of bedrooms, and more.
Property listings: The website displays detailed listings for each property, including images, descriptions, amenities, and contact information.
Inquiry form: Users can submit inquiries and contact the property owners or real estate agents directly through a contact form.
User authentication: Registered users can save favorite listings, track their inquiries, and manage their profile information.
Admin dashboard: An administration dashboard allows authorized users to manage property listings, user accounts, and other website settings.

# Technologies Used
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Templating Engine: Handlebars (or any other templating engine of your choice)
Authentication: Passport.js (or any other authentication library of your choice)
Maps Integration: Google Maps API (or any other maps service of your choic

Please note that the website is currently under construction, and only the HTML and CSS parts have been completed. You will need to complete the backend development, integrate the database, implement the chosen templating engine (such as Handlebars), set up authentication (using Passport.js or another library), and integrate maps (using the Google Maps API or another service) to fully realize the intended features.

Feel free to modify and extend the codebase as per your requirements. Update this README.md file with relevant information about the project's progress, planned features, and any additional setup steps or considerations that future contributors or users might need.

Happy developing!
